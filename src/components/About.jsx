                    Hi there,
                </p>
                <p className="text-gray-700">
                    I am Jose, a full stack developer with a Python Flask specialization and expertise in JavaScript, SQL, HTML and CSS. I build
                    secure, scalable RESTful APIs with JWT authentication and implement CRUD operations using ORM with MySQL. On the front end I
                    create responsive interfaces with React, Bootstrap and Tailwind CSS and manipulate the DOM to deliver seamless user experiences.
                    I leverage Git and GitHub for version control, Postman and Swagger for API testing and documentation and VS Code for
                    development. I also implement continuous integration and continuous delivery pipelines and write unit tests to ensure code
                    quality. I am fluent in English and Spanish, thrive in remote Agile teams and continuously expand my technical skill set.
                </p>

                    My journey through Coding Templeâ€™s apprenticeship and self-guided learning has given me deep experience in REST API development,
                    database modeling, and CI/CD workflows. I now build web applications where frontend polish meets backend reliability.
